# Adaptive-enrichment-with-joint-models
An adaptive enrichment clinical trial design which compares a joint model for longitudinal and time-to-event data with standard Cox models


The file "run_simulations.R" should be used to calibrate design parameters and run simulation studies.
The number of simulations has been left as N=1 for convenience but can be changed to N=10,000 to replicate results in the main paper and supplementary materials.
